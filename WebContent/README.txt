Notes: 
I have coded this without authentication i.e. using Client id and client secret key. I would have liked to have done more to this, but 
I did struggle in the beginning trying to use jquery based ajax calls which seemingly would throw an error. At the end I decided to go with the traditional
AJAX based call which returns the JSON object.
There was a lot of information to be displayed, but I thought name and address would be interesting.
To load the application, you have to deploy the  AND_Test. The Item input field is your search criteria and the max item field is your maximum number of input fields.
